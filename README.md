## Description

This project redesigns a soft, animated blob to express the emotion of panic through movement, interaction, and environmental feedback. As the user’s mouse approaches the blob, it reacts with increased speed, jitter, and instability, creating a sense of fear and loss of control.

The blob exists within a small map containing obstacles and movable objects. These elements reinforce the emotional experience by limiting movement and creating moments of collision and chaos. A bonus “mischief” mechanic allows the blob to bump or steal objects, adding playful tension to the interaction.

The design is inspired by the Side Quest Week 2 prompt and focuses on expressing emotion through motion rather than narrative or text.

## Interaction Instructions

- Open the project using the GitHub Pages playable link in Google Chrome.
- Move the mouse close to the blob to trigger panic behaviour.
- Observe changes in speed, shaking, and visual intensity as panic increases.
- Collide with objects to bump them around the map.
- Hold the **SHIFT** key while colliding with an object to steal it.

## Iteration Notes

### Post-Playtest

1. Increased acceleration and jitter when the mouse is very close to better communicate panic.
2. Added subtle screen shake to enhance emotional intensity.
3. Adjusted obstacle placement to reduce cases where the blob became stuck.

### Post-Showcase (Planned Improvements)

1. Add sound effects that increase in tempo as panic escalates.
2. Introduce additional emotional states that transition between calm and panic.

## Assets

All visuals are procedurally generated using p5.js.  
No external images, sounds, or assets were used.

---

## GenAI

GenAI tools were used to assist with debugging movement logic and brainstorming ways to translate emotional states into interactive behaviour. All generated suggestions were reviewed, tested, and modified by the student to ensure correctness and alignment with the assignment requirements.
